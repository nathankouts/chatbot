# Chatbot using Python
In this Python project, I am going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques.
The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. 
I used a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the userâ€™s message belongs to and then I gave a random response from the list of responses.
