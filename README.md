# Chatbot using Python
In this Python project, I am going to build a chatbot using deep learning techniques.
The chatbot will be trained on the dataset which contains categories (intents), pattern and responses. 
I used a special recurrent neural network (LSTM) to classify which category the user’s message belongs to and then we will give a random response from the list of responses.
Let’s create a retrieval based chatbot using NLTK, Keras, Python, etc.
